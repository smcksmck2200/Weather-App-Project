#  Weather Application

The Weather Application is an assignment from the XC Academy to create a full-stack express weather application. The application features an express backend and a pug frontend. A user can type in the name of a city and receive the current forecast of that city. I used https://www.weatherapi.com/  as my API.
## Application
The application is created using Express, a Node.js web application framework that provides features for web applications.  Body-parser is body parsing middleware, responsible for parsing the incoming request bodies in a middleware before you handle it. Node-fetch npm is a module that brings Fetch API to node.js. My API key and “port” are contained within the config.js file as an export, and the .gitignore file includes the node modules and config file. Pug is a Javascript library, and is a preprocessor that speeds up writing HTML. Two forms were created. The first form is used to provide the input's value from a submit button to fetch the API.  The second form displays the data from that input.
## Code
A “get” and “post” route is established. “Req.body.search” is a variable named “location” used in the fetch() method, beginning with the “q=” parameter used by the HTTP. The parsed response is now an object named “weather” which serves the data from the location. The response.render() method displays the submitted form's data.  The CSS stylings are personal preferences.
